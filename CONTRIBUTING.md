DiceDB welcomes your contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the documentation, your help is valuable. 

To maintain the project's quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

- Keep the code consistent: Use the same coding style and conventions throughout the project. 
- Keep the git repository consistent: Follow proper git practices to avoid conflicts and ensure a clean history. 

# Contribution Guidelines

Before you begin to contribute, make sure you have reviewed [Dev Environment Setup](https://github.com/dicedb/dice/blob/master/README.md) sections and that you have created your own fork of the source code.

## Create a branch for your change

```text
$ cd dice
#
# ensure you are starting from the latest code base
# the following steps, ensure your fork's (origin's) master is up-to-date
#
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
# create a branch for your issue
$ git checkout -b <your issue branch>
```

Make the necessary changes. If the changes you plan to make are too big, make sure you break them down into smaller tasks.

## Making the changes

Follow the best practices when you are making changes.

### Code documentation

Please ensure your code is adequately documented. Some things to consider for documentation:

- Always include struct, module, and package level docs. We are looking for information about what functionality is provided, what state is maintained, whether there are concurrency/thread-safety concerns and any exceptional behavior that the class might exhibit.
- Document public methods and their parameters.

### Code Formatting

To ensure code quality and consistency in our Go project, we use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/), a popular linter aggregator for Go. This tool combines multiple linters to catch common issues and enforce best practices in Go code.

To use golangci-lint, you need to have it installed. You can install it using the following methods:

- Via Homebrew (macOS):

```sh
brew install golangci/tap/golangci-lint
```

- Via Go:

```sh
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```

- Via Binary:

  You can download the latest binary release from the golangci-lint [releases page](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases)

We already have preconfigured [.golangci.yml](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/.golangci.yaml) file in the repository. Please follow the rules defined in the file.

To run golangci-lint and check your code for issues, use the following command:

```sh
golangci-lint run
```

### Backward and Forward compatibility changes

Make sure you consider both backward and forward compatibility issues while making your changes.

- For backward compatibility, consider cases where one component is using the new version and another is still on the old version. Will it break?
- For forward compatibility, consider rollback cases.

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)

- **Verify code-style**
- **Push changes and create a PR for review**

  Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.

```text
$ git add <files required for the change>
$ git commit -m "Meaningful oneliner for the change"
$ git push origin <your issue branch>

After this, create a PullRequest in `github <https://github.com/dicedb/docs/pulls>`_. Make sure you have linked the relevant Issue in the description with "Closes #number" or "Fixes #number".
```

- Once you receive comments on GitHub on your changes, be sure to respond to them on GitHub and address the concerns. If any discussions happen offline for the changes in question, make sure to capture the outcome of the discussion, so others can follow along as well.

  It is possible that while your change is being reviewed, other changes were made to the master branch. Be sure to pull rebase your change on the new changes thus:

```text
# commit your changes
$ git add <updated files>
$ git commit -m "Meaningful message for the update"
# pull new changes
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
$ git checkout <your issue branch>
$ git rebase master

At this time, if rebase flags any conflicts, resolve the conflicts and follow the instructions provided by the rebase command.

Run additional tests/validations for the new changes and update the PR by pushing your changes:
```

```text
git push origin <your issue branch>
```

- When you have addressed all comments and have an approved PR, one of the committers can merge your PR.
- After your change is merged, check to see if any documentation needs to be updated. If so, create a PR for documentation.

## Timeline for working on Issues

### Issues

- Assigned issues imply intent to work on them.
- Can't work on it? Unassign yourself to allow others to contribute.
- Provide updates on long-running issues to show progress.
- Inactive issues may be unassigned after a reasonable period.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- We appreciate timely completion of PRs.
- If a PR becomes inactive, we may close it.
- Need more time? Just let us know in the comments.
