### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking to setup DiceDB for development or want to setup from source, refer
> our [CONTRIBUTING/README.md](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING/README.md) guide.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.
