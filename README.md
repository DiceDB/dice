### What is DiceDB?

DiceDB is an open-source, fast, reactive, in-memory database optimized for modern hardware. Commonly used as a cache, it offers a familiar interface while enabling real-time data updates through query subscriptions. It delivers higher throughput and lower median latencies, making it ideal for modern workloads.

## Get started

### Setting up DiceDB with Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
$ docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb:latest
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

### Build from source

To build DiceDB from source, you need to have the following

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. Any of the below supported platform environments:
    1. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
    2. [OSX (Darwin) based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
    3. WSL under Windows

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb`. Execute the binary and that will
start the DiceDB server., or, you can run the following command to run like a usual
Go program

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

You can skip passing the flag if you are not working with `.WATCH` feature.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
$ sudo su
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

### Building from source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli
$ cd dicedb-cli
$ make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb-cli`. Execute the binary will
start the CLI and will try to connect to the DiceDB server.

## Essentials for Development

### Pointing to local checked-out `dicedb-go`

It is advised to checkout [dicedb-go](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-go) repository also because `dice` takes
a strong dependency on it. To point to the local copy add the following line
at the end of the `go.mod` file.

```
replace github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go => ../dicedb-go
```

Note: this is the literal line that needs to be added at the end of the go.mod file.
Refer to [this article](https://thewebivore.com/using-replace-in-go-mod-to-point-to-your-local-module/), to understand what it is and why it is needed.

Do not check-in the `go.mod` file with this change.

### Install GoLangCI

```bash
$ sudo su
$ sudo curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- -b /bin v1.64.6
```

### Local Setup with Custom Config

Follow these steps to generate and customize your dicedb configuration in a local setup:

```bash
$ go run main.go config-init
```

This will generate configuration file (`dicedb.yaml`) in metadata directory.
Metadata directory is OS-specific,

 - macOS: `/usr/local/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`
 - Linux: `/etc/dicedb/dicedb.yaml`

If you run with a `sudo` privileges, then these directories are used, otherwise
the current working directory is used as the metada directory.

### Running Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are essential for ensuring correctness and in the case of DiceDB, both types of tests are available to validate its functionality.

For unit testing, you can execute individual unit tests by specifying the name of the test function using the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable and running the `make unittest-one` command. Alternatively, running `make unittest` will execute all unit tests.

### Executing one unit test

```bash
TEST_FUNC=<name of the test function> make unittest-one
TEST_FUNC=TestByteList make unittest-one
```

### Running all unit tests

```bash
make unittest
```

Integration tests, on the other hand, involve starting up the DiceDB server and running a series of commands to verify the expected end state and output. To execute a single integration test, you can set the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable to the name of the test function and run `make test-one`. Running `make test` will execute all integration tests.

### Executing a single integration test

Make sure you have DiceDB running before you run the following commands.
By default it connects to the local instance of DiceDB running on port `7379`.

```bash
TEST_FUNC=<name of the test function> make test-one
TEST_FUNC=^TestSet$ make test-one
```

### Running all integration tests

```bash
$ make test
```

## Getting Started

To get started with building and contributing to DiceDB, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) created in this repository.

## Docs

We use [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework to power the [dicedb.io website](https://dicedb.io) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to power the docs. Once you have NodeJS installed, fire the following commands to get your local version of [dicedb.io](https://dicedb.io) running.

```bash
$ cd docs
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, visit http://localhost:4321/ in your favourite browser. This runs with a hot reload which means any changes you make in the website and the documentation can be instantly viewed on the browser.

### Docs directory structure

1. `docs/src/content/docs/commands` is where all the commands are documented
2. `docs/src/content/docs/tutorials` is where all the tutorials are documented

## How to contribute
