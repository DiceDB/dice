Dice
===

Dice ðŸŽ² is an extremely simple Golang-based in-memory KV store that speaks the Redis dialect.

> This is not production ready

## Why should you care?

Building a database from scratch has its own thrill, and you can leverage this to

- build a database from scratch
- learn database internals, starting with Redis
- learn about advanced data structures, algorithms, and event loops
- collaborate with other engineers and continute back to Open Source

## Setting up

To run DiceDB locally, you will need

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ go run main.go
```
## Run project inside Docker
1. go to project root folder and run  ```docker build .``` 
2. find docker image id using ```docker images``` and run the docker image ```docker run [Image ID]```
![Docker](/images/dice-doc-2.jpg?raw=true "docker")
3. find [CONTAINER ID] using  
```docker ps``` and get inside container using ```docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] bash```
4. Test the project working fine using 
```(printf '*1\r\n$4\r\nPING\r\n*3\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$1\r\nk\r\n$1\r\nv\r\n*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$1\r\nk\r\n';) | nc localhost 7379```

## Dice in action

Because Dice speaks Redis' dialect, you can connect to it with any Redis Client and the simplest way it to use a [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/manual/cli/). Programmatically, depending on the language you prefer, you can use your favourite Redis library to connect.

## Getting Started

To get started with building and contributing to DiceDB, please refer to the [issues](issues) created in this repository.

## The story

DiceDB started as a re-implementation of Redis in Golang and the idea was to - build a DB from scratch and understand the micro-nuances that comes with its implementation. The database does not aim to replace Redis, instead it will fit in and optimize itself for multi-core computations running on a single-threaded event loop.

## How to contribute

The Code Contribution Guidelines are published at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); please read them before you start making any changes. This would allow us to have a consistent standard of coding practices and developer experience.
