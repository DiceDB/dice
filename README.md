DiceDB
===

Dice ðŸŽ² is a drop-in replacement of Redis with SQL-based realtime reactivity baked in.

> Note: DiceDB is still in development and it supports a subset of Redis commands. So, please do not use it in production. But, feel free to go through the [open issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) and contribute to help us speed up the development.

## How is it different from Redis?

1. DiceDB is multi-threaded and follows [shared-nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture).
2. DiceDB supports a new command called `QWATCH` that lets clients listen to a SQL query and get notified in real-time whenever something changes.

## Get started

### Using Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```
$ docker run dicedb/dice-server
```

### Setting up

To run DiceDB for local development or running from source, you will need

1. [Golang](https://go.dev/)
2. Any of the below supported platform environment:
    1. [Linux based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
    2. [OSX (Darwin) based environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
$ cd dice
$ go run main.go
```

## Dice in action

Because Dice speaks Redis' dialect, you can connect to it with any Redis Client and the simplest way it to use a [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/manual/cli/). Programmatically, depending on the language you prefer, you can use your favourite Redis library to connect.

But if you are planning to use `QWATCH` feature then you need to use the DiceDB CLI that you can download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dicedb-cli/) by running the following command. The codebase for the same can be found at [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/cli/).

```
$ pip install dicedb-cli
```

## Running Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are essential for ensuring correctness and in the case of DiceDB, both types of tests are available to validate its functionality.

For unit testing, you can execute individual unit tests by specifying the name of the test function using the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable and running the `make unittest-one` command. Alternatively, running `make unittest` will execute all unit tests.

### Executing a single unit test

```
$ TEST_FUNC=<name of the test function> make unittest-one
$ TEST_FUNC=TestByteList make unittest-one
```

### Running all unit tests

```
$ make unittest
```

Integration tests, on the other hand, involve starting up the DiceDB server and running a series of commands to verify the expected end state and output. To execute a single integration test, you can set the `TEST_FUNC` environment variable to the name of the test function and run `make test-one`. Running `make test` will execute all integration tests.

### Executing a single integration test

```
$ TEST_FUNC=<name of the test function> make test-one
$ TEST_FUNC=TestSet make test-one
```

### Running all integration tests

```
$ make test
```

> Work to add more tests in DiceDB is in progress and we will soon port the
> test [Redis suite](https://github.com/redis/redis/tree/f60370ce28b946c1146dcea77c9c399d39601aaa) to this codebase to ensure full compatability.

## Running Benchmark

```sh
$ go test -test.bench <pattern>
$ go test -test.bench BenchmarkListRedis
```

## Getting Started

To get started with building and contributing to DiceDB, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) created in this repository.

## The story

DiceDB started as a re-implementation of Redis in Golang and the idea was to - build a DB from scratch and understand the micro-nuances that comes with its implementation. The database does not aim to replace Redis, instead it will fit in and optimize itself for multi-core computations running on a single-threaded event loop.

## How to contribute

## Troubleshoot

### Forcefully killing the process

```
$ sudo netstat -atlpn | grep :7379
$ sudo kill -9 <process_id>
```
