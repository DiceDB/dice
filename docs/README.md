DiceDB is an in-memory, real-time, and reactive database with Redis and SQL support optimized for modern hardware and building real-time applications. This repository holds the entire documentation hosted at [dicedb.io](https://dicedb.io).

## Get started

We use [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework to power the [dicedb.io website](https://dicedb.io) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to power the docs. Once you have NodeJS installed, fire the following commands to get your local version of [dicedb.io](https://dicedb.io) running.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, visit http://localhost:4321/ in your favourite browser. This runs with a hot reload which means any changes you make in the website and the documentation can be instantly viewed on the browser.

## To build and deploy

```
$ npm run build
```
