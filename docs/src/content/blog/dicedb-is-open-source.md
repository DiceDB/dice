Since the inception of DiceDB, [our](dicedb.io/team) vision has always been rooted in
building a high-performance caching backbone for modern architecture. Today, we are thrilled to announce that DiceDB
is now open source under the [GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) 3.0](https://github.com/dicedb/dice?tab=AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme).
This marks a significant milestone in our journey - one that reflects both our technical clarity and our commitment to the open-source ethos.

## Why We Switched from BSL to GNU AGPL 3.0

In the early days of DiceDB, we explored a [Business Source License (BSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License)
to balance monetization and community engagement. However, as our product evolved,
so did our understanding of its core mission.

DiceDB isn't just another in-memory database; it's the foundation for the next generation
of applications. By streamlining our
technical and business priorities, we realized that the
AGPL 3.0 license better aligns with where we are headed — an open,
collaborative ecosystem for the future of caching infrastructure.

As engineers, we believe in removing artificial barriers that gatekeep innovation.
The AGPL's principles align deeply with our philosophy — software should be free
to use, inspect, and improve. By adopting this license, we're doubling down
on accessibility and transparency. We believe that great infrastructure
shouldn't be proprietary; it should be a shared foundation for the ecosystem to build upon.

The AGPL license removes ambiguity around our open-source intent, signaling
to developers and organizations alike that DiceDB is here to stay as a
truly open technology. This clarity encourages collaboration, enabling developers and engineers to
confidently build, adapt, and contribute back to the project.
Whether it's improving availability, or performance, or even building advanced connectors,
every contribution will strengthen DiceDB for everyone.

Additionally, the AGPL is designed to ensure fairness. It prevents
the “freeloading” problem — where companies take open-source software, modify it,
and deploy it as a proprietary service without contributing back.
With the AGPL, any modifications made while running DiceDB as a
service must also be shared under the same license. This keeps the playing
field level, ensuring that innovation remains a collaborative effort rather than being siloed.

## What This Means for Developers

Developers now have the freedom to innovate with DiceDB. You
can freely use DiceDB, modify it, and build applications tailored to your specific needs.
By sharing improvements under the AGPL, you're contributing to a broader ecosystem that evolves
together. Every line of code written to build DiceDB is open for inspection, learning, and improvement.

## A Glimpse Into the Future

This license switch isn't just a symbolic move; it's a strategic decision. Our roadmap
includes multi-tenancy, horizontal scalability, infrastructure abstraction, reactivity,
observability, persistence, fault tolerance, seamless cluster management, and a
robust control plane with high observability.  

We are also enhancing query capabilities and data structure support to meet
the demands of AI-first applications—an approach poised to become the standard
in the coming decade. Furthermore, lightning-fast replica creation will reinforce
DiceDB's ability to handle production-grade workloads with exceptional reliability and resumability.

By going fully open-source under AGPL 3.0, we're inviting the
community to join us in building the caching backbone that powers the next generation of
applications. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible.

We're excited about this next chapter and can't wait to see how you
use and contribute to DiceDB. Here's [the repository](https://github.com/dicedb/dice),
let's build the future of real-time data together.
