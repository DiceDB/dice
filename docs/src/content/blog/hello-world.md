[DiceDB](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) is being revived with a bold new mission: to optimize and build a database that truly meets the demands of real-time applications. The world of real-time systems, both frontend and backend, is evolving rapidly, and so must the tools that underpin them. DiceDB will offer a robust and performant database solution specifically engineered for building and scaling real-time applications. Some key design decisions

- drop-in replacement for Redis - for easy adoption
- reactivity - subscribe to a SQL query and get results pushed to clients
- native, first-class JSON support for reads, writes, and queries
- in-memory, no disk overhead and every operation completes in 8 ms over the network
- built for modern hardware and squeezes every single ounce of performance

## Before we go build stuff

DiceDB isn't just another database; it's a platform purpose-built for the real-time era. As real-time systems become increasingly prevalent in modern applications, DiceDB's hyper-optimized architecture is positioned to power the next generation of user experiences.

We are just getting started.
