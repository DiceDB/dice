The `AUTH` command is a DiceDB command that enables you to authenticate a client connecting to the DiceDB server using a password. This command is particularly important in environments where the DiceDB instance is secured with access control measures, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the server and its data.

## Syntax

```
AUTH password
```

## Parameters

- `password` (string): The password that you have set for the DiceDB server. This is a required parameter for the `AUTH` command. If the password is correct, the command will return a success response; if it is incorrect, an error will be raised.

## Return Value

- On success: The command returns the string `OK`, indicating that the authentication was successful.
- On failure: If the authentication fails (due to an incorrect password), it raises an error indicating the failure reason.

## Behaviour

When the `AUTH` command is executed, DiceDB will perform the following steps:

1. `Check Authentication Status:` DiceDB will check if the server is configured to require authentication (i.e., if a password is set in the DiceDB configuration).
2. `Validate Password:` If authentication is required, DiceDB will then verify the provided password against the configured password.
3. `Return Response:`
   - If the password is valid, DiceDB will store the authenticated session for that client.
   - If the password is invalid, an error message will be returned.

Once authenticated, the client can execute commands on the DiceDB server that require authentication. If a client attempts to send commands without being authenticated (and while authentication is required), DiceDB will respond with an error for unauthorized access.

## Example Usage

### Successful Authentication

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> AUTH your_secret_password
OK
```

In this example, after successfully typing the correct password, the DiceDB server responds with `OK`, indicating that the client is now authenticated and can execute further commands.

### Failed Authentication

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> AUTH incorrect_password
(error) WRONGPASS invalid username-password pair or user is disabled
```

In this example, the provided password is incorrect. As a result, the DiceDB server responds with an error stating `(error) ERR invalid password`, indicating that the authentication has failed.

### Invoking commands without AUTH

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> GET x
(error) NOAUTH Authentication required
```

In this example, when some other command is fired without doing `AUTH` then the above error is thrown denoting that authentication is required.

## Error Handling

The `AUTH` command may raise the following errors:

- `(error) ERR invalid password`: This error occurs if the password provided to the `AUTH` command does not match the configured password of the DiceDB server. The client will not be granted access unless the correct password is provided.

- `(error) ERR Client sent AUTH but no password is set`: This error will be raised if the DiceDB server is not configured to use a password (i.e., the `requirepass` directive in the DiceDB.conf file is empty or commented out), and a client attempts to authenticate using the `AUTH` command.

### Additional Notes

- The `AUTH` command should be used cautiously, especially over unsecured connections, as plaintext passwords may be transmitted. Using TLS or other secure methods is recommended for production environments.
- Itâ€™s possible to configure DiceDB to allow multiple clients to connect concurrently from different IP addresses. Each client needs to authenticate separately.
- If you change the password in the DiceDB configuration, all connected clients must re-authenticate with the new password.
