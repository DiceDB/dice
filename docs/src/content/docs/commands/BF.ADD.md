A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It is highly space-efficient but allows for a small probability of false positives. The `BF.ADD` command is used to add an element to a Bloom Filter.

## Syntax

```bash
BF.ADD key item
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                      | Type   | Required |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| `key`     | The name of the Bloom Filter to which the item will be added. | String | Yes      |
| `item`    | The item to be added to the Bloom Filter.        | String | Yes      |

## Return values

| Condition                                      | Return Value                                      |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Item was not already present in the Bloom Filter | `1`                                              |
| Item was already present in the Bloom Filter (could be wrong)   | `0`                                              |

## Behaviour

When the `BF.ADD` command is executed, the specified item is added to the Bloom Filter associated with the given key. If the Bloom Filter does not already exist, it will be created automatically. The command will then check if the item is already present in the Bloom Filter:

- If the item is not present, it will be added, and the command will return `1`.
- If the item is already present, the command will return `0`.

## Errors

1. `Incorrect number of arguments`: 
    - Error message: `(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'BF.ADD' command`
    - The command requires exactly two arguments: the key and the item to be added to the Bloom Filter.
2. `Key is not a Bloom Filter`:
    - Error message: `(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value`
    - The specified key does not refer to a Bloom Filter.

## Example Usage

### Adding an Item to a Bloom Filter

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> BF.ADD mybloomfilter "apple"
(integer) 1
```

In this example, the item "apple" is added to the Bloom Filter named `mybloomfilter`. Since "apple" was not already present, the command returns `1`.

### Adding an Existing Item to a Bloom Filter

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> BF.ADD mybloomfilter "apple"
(integer) 0
```

In this example, the item "apple" is added to the Bloom Filter named `mybloomfilter` again. Since "apple" was already present, the command returns `0`.

### Error Scenario: Wrong Number of Arguments

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> BF.ADD mybloomfilter
(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'bf.add' command
```

In this example, the command is called with only one argument instead of the required two. An error is raised indicating the wrong number of arguments.

### Error Scenario: Non-string Key or Item

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET k 67890
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> BFADD 12345 67890
(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
```

In this example, the key and item are non-string values. An error is raised indicating the wrong type of value.
