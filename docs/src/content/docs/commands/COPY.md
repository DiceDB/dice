The `COPY` command in DiceDB is used to create a copy of a key. This command allows you to duplicate the value stored at a specified key to a new key. The new key can be in the same database or a different database. This command is useful for duplicating data without the need to retrieve and reinsert it manually.

## Syntax

```bash
COPY <source> <destination> [DB destination-db] [REPLACE]
```

## Parameters
|Parameter | Description | Type | Required| 
|----------|-------------|------|:---------:|
| source   |The key of the value you want to copy. This key must exist. | String | Yes|
| destination | The key where the value will be copied to. This key must not exist unless the `REPLACE` option is specified. | String | Yes |
|DB destination-db|The database number where the destination key will be created. If not specified, the destination key will be created in the same database as the source key. | Integer | optional|
|REPLACE|If specified, the command will overwrite the destination key if it already exists.| String | Optional|


## Return Value
| Condition | Return Value |
|-----------| :-------------:|
| key was copied successfully | `1` |
| key was not copied | `0` | 


## Behaviour

When the `COPY` command is executed, DiceDB will:

1. Check if the source key exists. If it does not, the command will return `0`.
2. Check if the destination key exists. If it does and the `REPLACE` option is not specified, the command will return `0`.
3. If the `DB destination-db` option is specified, DiceDB will switch to the specified database for the destination key.
4. Copy the value from the source key to the destination key.
5. Return `1` if the copy operation was successful.

## Error Handling

The `COPY` command can raise the following errors:

1. `Wrong type of value or key`:  
    - Error message `(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value`:  
    - This error occurs if the source key holds a value that is not compatible with the `COPY` operation.  
2.  `Not existent key`:  
    -  Error message: `(error) ERR no such key` 
    - This error occurs if the source key does not exist.  
    - This error occurs if the destination key already exists and the `REPLACE` option is not specified.

## Example Usage

### Basic Copy

Copy the value from `key1` to `key2` in the same database.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> COPY key1 key2
(integer) 1
```

### Copy with REPLACE

Copy the value from `key1` to `key2`, replacing `key2` if it already exists.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> COPY key1 key2 REPLACE
(integer) 1
```


### Not-Existent Source Key 

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> COPY nonexistent key2
(integer) 0
```

### Destination key already exist
```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> COPY key1 key2
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:7379> COPY key1 key2
(integer) 0 

```
## Notes

- The `COPY` command is available starting from DiceDB version 6.2.
- The `COPY` command is atomic, meaning that the copy operation is performed as a single, indivisible operation.
- The `COPY` command does not modify the source key; it only duplicates its value to the destination key.
- The `DB destinationDB` is not yet supported with the current versions of DiceDB. It acts as a placeholder for now. It will still return `0`
By understanding the `COPY` command and its parameters, you can effectively duplicate keys within your DiceDB databases, ensuring data consistency and reducing the need for manual data manipulation.
