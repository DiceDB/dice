description: Documentation for the DiceDB command GETEX
---

The `GETEX` command in DiceDB is used to retrieve the value of a specified key and simultaneously set its expiration time. This command is particularly useful when you want to access the value of a key and ensure that it expires after a certain period, all in a single atomic operation.

## Syntax

```
GETEX key [EX seconds|PX milliseconds|EXAT timestamp|PXAT milliseconds-timestamp|PERSIST]
```

## Parameters

- `key`: The key whose value you want to retrieve and set an expiration for.
- `EX seconds`: Set the expiration time in seconds.
- `PX milliseconds`: Set the expiration time in milliseconds.
- `EXAT timestamp`: Set the expiration time as a Unix timestamp in seconds.
- `PXAT milliseconds-timestamp`: Set the expiration time as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.
- `PERSIST`: Remove the existing expiration time, making the key persistent.

## Return Value

The `GETEX` command returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist, it returns `nil`.

## Behaviour

When the `GETEX` command is executed, it performs the following actions:

1. Retrieves the value of the specified key.
1. Sets the expiration time for the key based on the provided option (`EX`, `PX`, `EXAT`, `PXAT`, or `PERSIST`).
1. Returns the value of the key.

If the key does not exist, the command will return `nil` and no expiration time will be set.

## Error Handling

The `GETEX` command can raise errors in the following scenarios:

1. `Wrong number of arguments`: If the command is not provided with the correct number of arguments, it will return an error.
   - Error message: `(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'getex' command`
1. `Invalid expiration option`: If an invalid expiration option is provided, it will return an error.
   - Error message: `(error) ERR syntax error`
1. `Invalid expiration time`: If the expiration time is not a valid integer or timestamp, it will return an error.
   - Error message: `(error) ERR value is not an integer or out of range`

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Retrieve value and set expiration in seconds

```DiceDB
SET mykey "Hello"
GETEX mykey EX 10
```

- This command will return `"Hello"` and set the expiration time of `mykey` to 10 seconds.

### Example 2: Retrieve value and set expiration in milliseconds

```DiceDB
SET mykey "Hello"
GETEX mykey PX 10000
```

- This command will return `"Hello"` and set the expiration time of `mykey` to 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds).

### Example 3: Retrieve value and set expiration as Unix timestamp in seconds

```DiceDB
SET mykey "Hello"
GETEX mykey EXAT 1672531199
```

- This command will return `"Hello"` and set the expiration time of `mykey` to the Unix timestamp `1672531199`.

### Example 4: Retrieve value and set expiration as Unix timestamp in milliseconds

```DiceDB
SET mykey "Hello"
GETEX mykey PXAT 1672531199000
```

- This command will return `"Hello"` and set the expiration time of `mykey` to the Unix timestamp `1672531199000` milliseconds.

### Example 5: Retrieve value and remove expiration

```DiceDB
SET mykey "Hello"
EXPIRE mykey 10
GETEX mykey PERSIST
```

- This command will return `"Hello"` and remove the expiration time of `mykey`, making it persistent.

## Notes

- The `GETEX` command is atomic, meaning it ensures that the retrieval of the value and the setting of the expiration time happen as a single, indivisible operation.
- If the key does not exist, the command will return `nil` and no expiration time will be set.
- The `PERSIST` option is useful when you want to make a key persistent again after it has been set to expire.

By understanding and utilizing the `GETEX` command, you can efficiently manage key-value pairs in DiceDB with precise control over their expiration times.
