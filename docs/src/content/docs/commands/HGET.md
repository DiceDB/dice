---

The `HGET` command in DiceDB is used to retrieve the value associated with a specified field within a hash stored at a given key. If the key or the field does not exist, the command returns a `nil` value.

## Syntax

```bash
HGET key field
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                           | Type    | Required |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `key`     | The key of the hash from which the field's value is to be retrieved.  | String  | Yes      |
| `field`   | The field within the hash whose value is to be retrieved.             | String  | Yes      |

## Return Values

| Condition                                   | Return Value                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Field exists in the hash                    | `String` (value of the field)                                               |
| Key does not exist or field not present     | `nil`                                                                       |
| Wrong data type                             | `(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value` |
| Incorrect Argument Count                    | `(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'hget' command`                  |

## Behaviour

When the `HGET` command is executed, DiceDB performs the following steps:

- It checks if the key exists in the database.
- If the key exists and is of type hash, it then checks if the specified field exists within the hash.
- If the field exists, it retrieves and returns the value associated with the field.
- If the key does not exist or the field is not present in the hash, it returns `nil`.

## Errors

1. `Non-hash type or wrong data type`:

   - Error Message: `(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value`
   - Occurs if `key` holds a non-hash data structure.

2. `Incorrect Argument Count`:

   - Error Message: `(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'hget' command`
   - Occurs if the command is not provided with the correct number of arguments (i.e., fewer than two).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Retrieving a value from a hash

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> HSET user:1000 name "John Doe"
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:7379> HSET user:1000 age "30"
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET user:1000 name
"John Doe"
```

#### Field does not exist

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET user:1000 email
(nil)
```

#### Key does not exist

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET user:2000 name
(nil)
```

### Key is not a hash

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET user:3000 "Not a hash"
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET user:3000 name
(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
```

### Invalid Usage

Trying to get a field from a key that is not a hash.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET product:2000 "This is a string"
OK
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET product:2000 name
(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
```
- **Behavior**: The `SET` command sets the key `product:2000` to a string value.
- **Error**: The `HGET` command will raise a WRONGTYPE error because `product:2000` is not a hash.

Wrong Number of Arguments for HGET Command

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> HGET product:2000
(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'hget' command

127.0.0.1:7379> HGET product:2000 name name2
(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'hget' command
```
- **Behavior**: The `HGET` command requires exactly two arguments: the key and the field name.
- **Error**: The command will raise an error if provided with an incorrect number of arguments, indicating that the command requires a specific count.

## Notes

- The `HGET` command is a read-only command and does not modify the hash or any other data in the DiceDB database.

By understanding the `HGET` command, you can efficiently retrieve values from hashes stored in your DiceDB database, ensuring that your application can access the necessary data quickly and reliably.
