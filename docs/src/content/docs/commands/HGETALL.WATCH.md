#### Syntax

```
HGETALL.WATCH key
```


HGETALL.WATCH creates a query subscription over the HGETALL command. The client invoking the command
will receive the output of the HGETALL command (not just the notification) whenever the value against
the key is updated.

You can update the key in any other client. The HGETALL.WATCH client will receive the updated value.
