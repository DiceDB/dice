This command is particularly useful for understanding how much longer a key will exist before it expires.

The `PTTL` command in DiceDB is used to retrieve the remaining time to live (TTL) of a key in milliseconds. This command is particularly useful for understanding how much longer a key will exist before it expires. If the key does not have an associated expiration, the command will return a specific value indicating this state.

## Syntax

```
PTTL key
```

## Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                                                              | Type    | Required |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `key`           | The key for which the remaining TTL is to be retrieved.                  | String  | Yes      |

## Return values

| Condition                                                  | Return Value      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Command is successful                                      | Returns a positive integer value representing the remaining time to live of the key in milliseconds |
| The key exists but has no associated expiration            | `-1`              |
| The key does not exist                                     | `-2`              |


## Behaviour

- The command is non-destructive and does not modify the key or its expiration in any way.
- If a key's TTL is modified (e.g., by `EXPIRE` or `PEXPIRE` commands), subsequent `PTTL` calls will reflect the updated remaining time.


## Errors

1. `Wrong number of arguments`:

   - Error Message: `(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'pttl' command`
   - Occurs when attempting to use this command without any arguments or with more than one argument.


## Example Usage

### Example 1: Key with Expiration

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET mykey "Hello"
127.0.0.1:7379> EXPIRE mykey 10
127.0.0.1:7379> PTTL mykey
(integer) 10000
```

In this example, the key `mykey` is set with a value of "Hello" and an expiration of 10 seconds. The `PTTL` command returns `10000`, indicating that the key will expire in 10000 milliseconds.

### Example 2: Key without Expiration

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET mykey "Hello"
127.0.0.1:7379> PTTL mykey
(integer) -1
```

In this example, the key `mykey` is set with a value of "Hello" but no expiration is set. The `PTTL` command returns `-1`, indicating that the key exists but has no associated expiration.

### Example 3: Non-existent Key

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> PTTL nonExistentKey
(integer) -2
```

In this example, the key `nonExistentKey` does not exist in the DiceDB database. The `PTTL` command returns `-2`, indicating that the key does not exist.

### Example 4: Invalid usage

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET newkey "value"
127.0.0.1:7379> PTTL newkey value
(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'pttl' command
```

In this example, the `PTTL` command is used with an extra argument. This results in an error, as the `PTTL` command accepts only one argument.
