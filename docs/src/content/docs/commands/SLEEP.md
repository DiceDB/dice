The `SLEEP` command in DiceDB is used to pause the execution of the current client connection for a specified number of seconds. This command is primarily useful for testing purposes, such as simulating network latency or delaying operations to observe the behavior of other commands in a controlled environment.

## Syntax

```bash
SLEEP seconds
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                               | Type   | Required |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| `seconds` | An integer representing the number of seconds to sleep. Only integers values are allowed.      | Integer  | Yes      |


## Return values

| Condition                               | Return Value                                    |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Command is successful                   | `OK` after specified sleep duration has elapsed |
| Syntax or specified datatype is invalid | error                                           |


## Behaviour

When the `SLEEP` command is executed, the following behavior is observed:

1. The client connection that issued the `SLEEP` command will be paused for the specified duration.
2. During this sleep period, the client will not be able to send or receive any other commands.
3. Other clients connected to the DiceDB server will not be affected and can continue to execute commands normally.
4. After the sleep duration has elapsed, the client will receive an "OK" response and can resume normal operations.

## Errors

The `SLEEP` command can raise errors under the following conditions:

1. `Invalid Number of Arguments`:
   - Error Message: `ERR wrong number of arguments for 'sleep' command`
   - Occurs if the `SLEEP` command is called without the required `seconds` parameter or with more than one parameter.

2. `Invalid Parameter Type`:
   - Error Message: `ERR value is not an integer or out of range`
   - Occurs if the `seconds` parameter is not a valid integer.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Basic Usage

Pause the client for 5 seconds.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SLEEP 5
OK
```

### Example 2: Error Handling - Missing Parameter

Attempt to call `SLEEP` without specifying the `seconds` parameter.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SLEEP
(error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'sleep' command
```

### Example 3: Error Handling - Invalid Parameter Type

Attempt to call `SLEEP` with a non-integer parameter.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SLEEP abc
(error) ERR value is not an integer or out of range
```

## Notes

- The `SLEEP` command is a blocking operation for the client that issues it. It does not affect the server's ability to handle other clients.
- This command is useful for testing and debugging purposes but should be used with caution in production environments to avoid unintended delays.
