#### Syntax

```
UNWATCH <fingerprint>
```


WATCH command creates a subscription to the key and returns a fingerprint. Use this fingerprint to UNWATCH the subscription.
After running the UNWATCH command, the subscription will be removed and the data changes will no longer be sent to the client.

Note: If you are using the DiceDB CLI, then you need not run this command given the REPL will implicitly run this command when
you exit the watch mode.
	

#### Examples

```

localhost:7379> UNWATCH 2356444921
	
```
