#### Syntax

```
ZCARD.WATCH key
```


ZCARD.WATCH creates a query subscription over the ZCARD command. The client invoking the command
will receive the output of the ZCARD command (not just the notification) whenever the value against
the key is updated.

You can update the key in any other client. The ZCARD.WATCH client will receive the updated value.
