#### Syntax

```
ZCOUNT.WATCH key min max
```


ZCOUNT.WATCH creates a query subscription over the ZCOUNT command. The client invoking the command
will receive the output of the ZCOUNT command (not just the notification) whenever the value against
the key is updated.

You can update the key in any other client. The ZCOUNT.WATCH client will receive the updated value.
