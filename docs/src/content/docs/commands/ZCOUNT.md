#### Syntax

```
ZCOUNT key min max
```


ZCOUNT counts the number of members in a sorted set between min and max (both inclusive)

If you want to use unbounded ranges, use -inf and +inf for min and max respectively.
The command returns the count of members in a sorted set between min and max (both inclusive). Returns 0 if the key does not exist.
