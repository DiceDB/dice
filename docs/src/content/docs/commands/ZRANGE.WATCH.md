#### Syntax

```
ZRANGE.WATCH key start stop [BYSCORE | BYRANK]
```


ZRANGE.WATCH creates a query subscription over the ZRANGE command. The client invoking the command
will receive the output of the ZRANGE command (not just the notification) whenever the value against
the key is updated.

You can update the key in any other client. The ZRANGE.WATCH client will receive the updated value.
