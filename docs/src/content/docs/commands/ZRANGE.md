#### Syntax

```
ZRANGE key start stop
```


ZRANGE returns the range of elements from the sorted set stored at key.

The elements are considered to be ordered from the lowest to the highest score. Both start and
stop are 0-based indexes, where 0 is the first element, 1 is the next element and so on.

#### Examples

```

localhost:7379> ZADD s 1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d 5 e
OK 5
localhost:7379> ZRANGE s 1 3
OK
0) a=1
1) b=2
2) c=3

```
