#### Syntax

```
ZRANK.WATCH key
```


ZRANK.WATCH creates a query subscription over the ZRANK command. The client invoking the command
will receive the output of the ZRANK command (not just the notification) whenever the value against
the key is updated.

You can update the key in any other client. The ZRANK.WATCH client will receive the updated value.
