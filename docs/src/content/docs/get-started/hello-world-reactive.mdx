DiceDB is a [reactive database](/reactivity/) that allows you to create query subscriptions.
When you `WATCH` a particular key or command, DiceDB proactively executes the
query and sends you the result whenever the data changes.

This eliminates the need to poll the database for changes or work with change events.
To demonstrate this, here's a quick "Hello, World!" example.

But, before we start, make sure you have
complete the [Hello, World!](/get-started/hello-world/) example.

## Watching a key

To see what reactivity is, let's watch a key.

You need to open three terminal sessions, connect all of them with the same DiceDB server using the DiceDB CLI.

In the first _two_ terminal sessions, run the following command to watch the key `k1`.

```bash
localhost:7379> GET.WATCH k1
```

In the third terminal session, run the following command to set the value of `k1` to `v1`.

```bash
localhost:7379> SET k1 v1
OK OK
```

In the first two terminal sessions, you will see the following output.

```bash
localhost:7379> GET.WATCH k1
entered the watch mode for GET.WATCH k1
OK [fingerprint=2356444921] v1
```

Now, if you set the value of `k1` to `v2`, you will see the following output in the first two terminal sessions.

```bash
localhost:7379> GET.WATCH k1
entered the watch mode for GET.WATCH k1
OK [fingerprint=2356444921] v1
OK [fingerprint=2356444921] v2
```

This is the reactivity in action. Here you are watching the key `k1` and getting notified
whenever the value of `k1` changes, but it is not just a change event, but the actual result set.
This makes it really powerful and flexible to build real-time applications.

> Note: In CLI, you can watch one command at a time, but programmatically you can watch multiple commands at the same time
> and handle them in parallel. You can take a look at our [Chatroom](/tutorials/chatroom/) to see how to do that.

## What else can I watch?

Any readonly command will have a `.WATCH` version that allows you to watch the result of the command.
This is a simple convention that we follow to make it easier to understand what is being watched.

> we are in process of implementing the `.WATCH` commands for all query commands in DiceDB,

> With subsequent releases, we will keep shipping `.WATCH` commands for all the
