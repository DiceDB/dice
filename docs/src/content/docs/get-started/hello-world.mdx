Before we start with Hello, World program for DiceDB, make sure you have

1. a running instance of DiceDB
2. installed [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-cli)

You can follow the steps mentioned in the [installation](/get-started/installation/) guide to wrap up the installation.

## Starting DiceDB

Once the DiceDB server starts, you will see output similar to this

```

## Starting the DiceDB CLI

DiceDB CLI is your portal to all things DiceDB, and once you start
you will get a REPL to interact with the database and it looks
something like this

```bash
localhost:7379>
```

This indicates that you're connected to the default DiceDB instance on your local machine on port 7379.

## A simple Set-Get Example

DiceDB is a KV store and one of the most basic operations is to store a key and a value
and then retrieve it.

To store `<k1, v1>` in DiceDB, we use the [`SET`](/commands/set) command and
then retrieve it using the [`GET`](/commands/get) command.

```bash
localhost:7379> SET k1 v1
OK
localhost:7379> GET k1
OK "v1"
```

Here's a breakdown of what happened,

- `SET`: This is the DiceDB command to store a value
- `k1`: This is the key we're assigning to the value
- `v1`: This is the actual value we want to store. It's a simple string in this case
- `OK`: DiceDB's response indicating successful storage


### Bottom Line

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DiceDB.
We've covered the basics of connecting to a DiceDB instance, storing a simple string, and retrieving it.
The true power of DiceDB lies in its ability to intuitively build reactive applications
like [chatrooms](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/tree/master/examples/chatroom-go) and
[leaderboards](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/tree/master/examples/leaderboard-go),
handle complex data structures and perform operations efficiently.
But all of that after we do our first tutorial for reactivity and query subscriptions.
