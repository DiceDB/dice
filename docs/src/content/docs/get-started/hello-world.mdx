Before we start with Hello, World program for DiceDB, make sure you have

1. a running instance of DiceDB
2. installed DiceDB CLI

You can follow the steps mentioned in the [installation](/get-started/installation/) guide to get started with DiceDB.

### Starting DiceDB

```
dicedb
```

Once the server starts, you will see output similar to this

```
2024/08/01 23:44:24 INFO starting an asynchronous TCP server on 0.0.0.0=7379
2024/08/01 23:44:24 INFO ready to accept connections
```

### Starting the DiceDB CLI

To begin, ensure DiceDB is running on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
dice
```

This command launches the DiceDB CLI, presenting you with a prompt similar to this:

```
127.0.0.1:7379>
```

This indicates that you're connected to the default DiceDB instance on your local machine (port 7379).

### Storing Data: The SET Command

Let's store our "Hello, World!" message in DiceDB. We'll use the [`SET`](/commands/set) command, which is responsible for storing a string value under a specified key.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> SET mykey "Hello, World!"
OK
```

Here's a breakdown of what happened:

- `SET`: This is the DiceDB command to store a value.
- `mykey`: This is the key we're assigning to the value.
- `"Hello, World!"`: This is the actual value we want to store. It's a simple string in this case.
- `OK`: DiceDB's response indicating successful storage.

### Retrieving Data: The GET Command

Now, let's fetch the stored value using the `GET` command.

```bash
127.0.0.1:7379> GET mykey
"Hello, World!"
```

The [`GET`](/commands/get) command retrieves the value associated with the specified key. In this case, we retrieved the "Hello, World!" message we stored earlier.

### Closing the Connection

To exit the DiceDB CLI, you can press `Ctrl+D` or type `exit`.

### Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DiceDB.
We've covered the basics of connecting to a DiceDB instance, storing a simple string, and retrieving it.
The true power of DiceDB lies in its ability to intuitively build realtime reactive applications like [leaderboards](/tutorials/realtime-leaderboard/),
handle complex data structures and perform operations efficiently.
