Before we start with Hello, World program for DiceDB, make sure you have

1. a running instance of DiceDB
2. installed [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-cli)

You can follow the steps mentioned in the [installation](/get-started/installation/) guide to wrap up the installation.

### Starting DiceDB

Once the DiceDB server starts, you will see output similar to this

```

2024-10-24T06:25:32Z INF starting DiceDB version=0.0.5
2024-10-24T06:25:32Z INF running with port=7379
2024-10-24T06:25:32Z INF running with enable-watch=true
2024-10-24T06:25:32Z INF running with mode=multi-threaded num-shards=32
2024-10-24T06:25:32Z INF ready to accept and serve requests on port=7379
```

### Starting the DiceDB CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt and fire the following command

```bash
dicedb-cli
```

This command launches the DiceDB CLI REPL, presenting you with a prompt similar to this

```
Connected to DiceDB. Type 'exit' or press Ctrl+D to exit.
dicedb>
```

This indicates that you're connected to the default DiceDB instance on your local machine on port 7379.

### Storing Data: The SET Command

Let's store `<k1, v1>` in DiceDB. We'll use the [`SET`](/commands/set) command, which is responsible for storing a string value under a specified key.

```bash
dicedb> SET k1 v1
OK
```

Here's a breakdown of what happened:

- `SET`: This is the DiceDB command to store a value.
- `k1`: This is the key we're assigning to the value.
- `v1`: This is the actual value we want to store. It's a simple string in this case.
- `OK`: DiceDB's response indicating successful storage.

### Retrieving Data: The GET Command

Now, let's fetch the stored value using the `GET` command.

```bash
dicedb> GET k1
v1
```

The [`GET`](/commands/get) command retrieves the value associated with the specified key. In this case, we retrieved the "v1" message we stored earlier.

### Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DiceDB.
We've covered the basics of connecting to a DiceDB instance, storing a simple string, and retrieving it.
The true power of DiceDB lies in its ability to intuitively build realtime reactive applications like [leaderboards](/tutorials/realtime-leaderboard/),
handle complex data structures and perform operations efficiently.
