DiceDB is a redis-compliant, in-memory, real-time, and reactive database optimized for modern hardware and for building and scaling truly real-time applications. 

We are looking for Early Design Partners, so, if you want to evaluate DiceDB, [block our calendar](https://cal.com/dicedb-arpit). always up for a chat.

> Note: DiceDB is still in development and it supports a subset of Redis commands. So, please do not use it in production. But, feel free to go through the [open issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) and contribute to help us speed up the development.

### Setting up DiceDB server

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb --enable-multithreading --enable-watch
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

### Setting up CLI

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
sudo su
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.
