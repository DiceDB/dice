DiceDB is an open source, reactive, scalable, highly available, unified cache optimized for modern hardware.

## Setting up DiceDB server

### Using Docker

The easiest way to get started with DiceDB is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by running the following command.

```bash
docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb --enable-watch
```

The above command will start the DiceDB server running locally on the port `7379` and you can connect
to it using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and SDKs.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dicedb/dice
cd dice
make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb`. Execute the binary and that will
start the DiceDB server.

## Setting up CLI

### Using cURL

The best way to connect to DiceDB is using [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) and you can install it by running the following command

```bash
sudo su
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

If you are working on unsupported OS (as per above script), you can always follow the installation instructions mentioned in the [dicedb/cli](https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli) repository.

### Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli
cd dicedb-cli
make build
```

The above command will create a binary `dicedb-cli`. Execute the binary will
start the CLI and will try to connect to the DiceDB server.
