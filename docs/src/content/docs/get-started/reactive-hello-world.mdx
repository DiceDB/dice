DiceDB is a truly reactive database allows you to create query subscriptions on the database
and get notified whenever the data changes, thus eradicating the need to poll the database for changes. This is a simple Hello, World! example to get a taste of reactivity.

But, before we start, make sure you have

1. a running instance of DiceDB
2. installed [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/dicedb/dicedb-cli)

### Starting DiceDB

Start the DiceDB server with the two flags `--enable-multithreading` and `--enable-watch`
to enable multi-threading and watch mode, respectively. Your command would look something
like this

```bash
docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb --enable-multithreading --enable-watch
```

Also, connect to the database using the CLI as mentioned in the above installation steps or
the previous hello world example.

### Storing Data: The SET Command

Let's store `<k1, v1>` in DiceDB. We'll use the [`SET`](/commands/set) command, which is responsible for storing a string value under a specified key.

```bash
dicedb> SET k1 v1
OK
```

### Watch `k1` in two terminal sessions

Now, open two terminal sessions, connect both with the same DiceDB server using the DiceDB CLI
and watch the changes on the key `k1` in both the sessions.

```bash
dicedb> GET.WATCH k1
```

In return you will get fingerprint and initial data which you can ignore for now.

At this step you have total 3 terminal sessions,

1. one where you fired the `SET k1 v1` command
2. two where you fired the `GET.WATCH k1` command

### Update the value of `k1`

Now, go back to the first terminal session and update the value of `k1` to `v2` using the `SET` command.

```bash
dicedb> set k1 v2
OK
```

Now, you will see the changes in the other two terminal sessions where you have watched the key `k1`
and you will get the updated value `v2` in both the sessions.

This is the reactivity in action. You can create multiple subscriptions on the database and get notified whenever the data changes.
[CDC (Change Data Capture)](https://www.confluent.io/learn/change-data-capture/) notifies the subscribers
about the changes in the database and sends an event with the delta, but but DiceDB
evaluates the query/command and sends the updated result set to the subscribers.

This can be used to build real-time applications like leaderboards, monitoring, alerting, instant recommendations, etc.

## WATCH commands

We are in process of implementing the `.WATCH` commands for all query commands in DiceDB,
but today we support [`GET.WATCH`](/commands/getwatch), [`ZRANGE.WATCH`](/commands/zrangewatch) and [`PFCOUNT.WATCH`](/commands/pfcountwatch). You can read more about them
in the commands documentation.

With subsequent releases, we will keep shipping `.WATCH` commands for all the query commands in DiceDB.
