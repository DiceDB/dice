In the world of gaming, leaderboards are a critical part of many real-time systems and are essential for tracking player
rankings and improving engagement.
DiceDB is a truly reactive database which allows you to eradicate the need to poll the database for changes by allowing clients to subscribe to changes in a sorted set (like a leaderboard).
thus making it an excellent fit for implementing leaderboards.
The goal of this example is to build a real-time leaderboard with DiceDB. We'll walk through the process of creating a gaming leaderboard using sorted set commands and our DiceDB SDK.

But, before we start, make sure you have

1. Go installed (at least version 1.18)
2. Running instance of DiceDB
3. Basic familiarity with [DiceDB and its CLI](https://github.com/dicedb/dice?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started)

## Environment setup

### Starting DiceDB

Start the DiceDB server with the two flags `--enable-multithreading`, and `--enable-watch`
to enable multi-threading and watch mode, respectively. Your command would look something
like this

```bash
docker run -p 7379:7379 dicedb/dicedb --enable-multithreading --enable-watch
```

Once the DiceDB server starts, you will see output similar to this

```
██████╗ ██╗ ██████╗███████╗██████╗ ██████╗
██╔══██╗██║██╔════╝██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔══██╗
██║  ██║██║██║     █████╗  ██║  ██║██████╔╝
██║  ██║██║██║     ██╔══╝  ██║  ██║██╔══██╗
██████╔╝██║╚██████╗███████╗██████╔╝██████╔╝
╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝╚══════╝╚═════╝ ╚═════╝

2024-10-24T18:35:55Z INF starting DiceDB version=0.0.5
2024-10-24T18:35:55Z INF running with port=7379
2024-10-24T18:35:55Z INF running with enable-watch=true
2024-10-24T18:35:55Z INF running with mode=multi-threaded num-shards=12
2024-10-24T18:35:55Z INF ready to accept and serve requests on port=7379
```

### Starting the application server

1. Clone the repository
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/arpitbbhayani/leaderboard-go-dicedb.git
     cd leaderboard-go-dicedb
     ```
2. Start the application
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    This will start the application server on port 8080 by default, you should see output similar to
    ```bash
    2024/10/25 00:05:59 Server starting on :8080
    ```

### Interacting with the application
1. Navigate to the application server from your desired browser at http://localhost:8080.
2. Update player with their respective scores.
3. As more player with scores get added, we can see players getting ranked accordingly.

## Key Components

1. DiceDB: As the in-memory data store to realtime track user scores.
2. DiceDB Go SDK: To allow interaction between application server and DiceDB.
3. `ZRANGEWATCH` command: Allows the application to subscribe to changes in the leaderboard.
4. `ZADD` command: We'd leverage this command to add scores for users.
5. Websocket: To push real-time updates to connected users.

In this application, every player assigned with higher score is ranked at the top of leaderboard.

```
Client (WebSocket)  →  Go Application  →  DiceDB (ZADD)
             ↑                                  ↓
Leaderboard Update  ←  Go Application ← DiceDB (ZRANGEWATCH)
                                         (Real-Time Update)
```

## Understanding Real-Time Reactivity with `ZRANGEWATCH`

The `ZRANGEWATCH` command allows the application to subscribe to changes in the leaderboard.
This allows users to eradicate the need to continuously poll the server as updates are automatically delivered whenever changes occur.
`ZRANGEWATCH` only sends the relevant changes to clients, making the process highly efficient in terms of both bandwidth and processing power.

### Flow of `ZRANGEWATCH`:

1. Setup: The client subscribes to updates on the leaderboard using `ZRANGEWATCH`.
2. Data Changes: Whenever a player's score is updated, DiceDB triggers an update.
3. Push Notifications: The server pushes the updated scores to all connected clients through WebSocket.

## Code overview

1. WebSocket Handling: The code uses WebSocket to push real-time updates to connected users.
    ```go
    func handleWebSocket(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return
        }

        connectedUsers = append(connectedUsers, conn)
    }
    ```
    - This function establishes a WebSocket connection with clients. All connected clients are stored in connectedUsers.
    - Once connected, clients will receive real-time updates whenever there is a change in the leaderboard.

2. Score Updates: The `handleUpdate` function processes incoming HTTP requests to update player scores.
    ```go
    func handleUpdate(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
         var score Score
         if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&score); err != nil {
             http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
             return
         }

         // ZADD command to add player with scores to leaderboard
         err := client.ZAdd(r.Context(), "leaderboard", dicedb.Z{
             Score:  float64(score.Score),
             Member: score.Name,
         }).Err()

         if err != nil {
             http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
             return
         }

         w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    }
    ```
    - This function receives a JSON payload with a player's name and score, and then updates the leaderboard using `ZADD` command.
    - If the player already exists, their score is updated. Otherwise, a new player is added to the leaderboard.

3. Watch Loop: This is where the magic happens. The `watchLoop` function listens for updates from DiceDB and pushes them to all connected clients.
    ```go
    func watchLoop() {
        ctx := context.Background()

        // Established watch connection with DiceDB using WatchConn.
        watchConn = client.WatchConn(ctx)
        if watchConn == nil {
            log.Fatal("failed to create watch connection")
            return
        }

        // ZRANGEWATCH Command to subscribe to updates from DiceDB. Arguments are as follows:
        // ctx: context object for the request.
        // "leaderboard": The name of the key set to be watched.
        // "0": The starting index of the watch range.
        // "5": The ending index of the range. This tells the watch command to monitor up to the 5th element in the leaderboard.
        // "REV": Specifies that the result should be in descending order of scores.
        // "WITHSCORES": Ensures that both the player name and score are returned in the response.
        res, err := watchConn.ZRangeWatch(ctx, "leaderboard", "0", "5", "REV", "WITHSCORES")
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("failed to create watch connection:", err)
            return
        }
        watchTopics[res.Fingerprint] = "global_leaderboard"

        watchCh = watchConn.Channel()

        // Loop over channel to listen for updates from DiceDB
        for {
            select {
            case msg := <-watchCh:
                switch watchTopics[msg.Fingerprint] {
                case "global_leaderboard":
                    var scores []Score
                    for _, z := range msg.Data.([]dicedb.Z) {
                        scores = append(scores, Score{
                            Name:  z.Member.(string),
                            Score: int(z.Score),
                        })
                    }

                    // Loop over connected users to send the score updates
                    for _, conn := range connectedUsers {
                        if err := conn.WriteJSON(scores); err != nil {
                            log.Println("websocket write error:", err)
                        }
                    }
                }
            case <-ctx.Done():
                return
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - Watch Connection: A Watch Connection is established with DiceDB using WatchConn.
    - `ZRANGEWATCH`: This command watches the top 5 scores of the leaderboard.
    - Real-Time Updates: Whenever there's a change in the leaderboard, the watch channel(`watchCh`) receives an update, which is then broadcast to all connected clients via WebSocket.

## Conclusion

DiceDB provides a powerful and efficient solution for implementing gaming leaderboards.
By using DiceDB reactivity feature, you can create fast, scalable, and feature-rich leaderboards for your games,
without having to

1. periodically poll for the data, or
2. knowing the internal data structures like Sorted Set.
