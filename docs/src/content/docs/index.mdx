> Note: DiceDB is still in development and it supports a subset of Redis commands. So, please do not use it in production. But, feel free to go through the [open issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) and contribute to help us speed up the development.

## How is it different from Redis?

1. [DiceDB](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice) is multi-threaded and follows [shared-nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture).
2. [DiceDB](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice) supports a new command called `QWATCH` that lets clients listen to a SQL query and get notified in real-time whenever something changes.
