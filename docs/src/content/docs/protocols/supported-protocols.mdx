DiceDB supports 3 ways to connect to the database:

1. [TCP-RESP](#tcp-resp)
2. [HTTP](#http)
3. [WebSockets](#websockets)

## TCP-RESP

RESP is a protocol over TCP. This is the default mode of communication with dicedb.

| Name         | Value | Configuration                |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| Default Port | 7379  | `server.port` in config file |

To use Dice over TCP/RESP, you can and should use the official [DiceDB CLI](https://github.com/DiceDB/cli).

## HTTP

Clients can also connect to DiceDB over HTTP. This allows clients to connect to dice over the web stack, enabling frontends to have direct access to dice.

| Name         | Value | Configuration      |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------ |
| Default Port | 8082  | `--http-port` flag |

[//]: # "For all commands except `QWATCH`, the HTTP API is synchronous and will return the result of the command immediately."
[//]: #
[//]: # "For [`QWATCH`](/commands/qwatch), we use [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) to be able to respond with changes to the result set of the queries."

To understand the request and response format better, please refer to the [HTTP Protocol](/protocols/http) documentation.

### When to use HTTP

- To connect to dice from a web frontend.
- When you do not have access to a raw TCP connection.
- Integrate dice with other web services using HTTP Webhooks.

[//]: # "- With small number of queries you want to `QWATCH`."
[//]: # "### Limitations"
[//]: #
[//]: # "- `QWATCH` uses SSE or Server Sent Events, and current implementation of HTTP in DiceDB is based on HTTP 1.1. This means that there would be a limit to how many queries you can `QWATCH` at a time ([ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource))."
[//]: # "- `QWATCH` using SSE also implies that the connection is stateful and the client needs to handle reconnections in case of network failures."

## WebSockets

WebSockets protocol on DiceDB allows clients to connect to dice over a persistent websocket connection. This allows clients to connect to dice over the web while also being able to bypass the limitations of SSE. Websocket being a full-duplex protocol, allows clients to send and receive messages simultaneously.

| Name         | Value | Configuration           |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------- |
| Default Port | 8379  | `--websocket-port` flag |

To understand the request and response format better, please refer to the [WebSockets Protocol](/protocols/websockets) documentation.

### When to use WebSockets

- To connect to dice from a web frontend and maintain a persistent connection.
- In cases wher you need large amount/high frequency of live updates being pushed from dice to the client.
- To build real-time applications with high frequency of updates like collaborative editing, real-time gaming, etc.

[//]: # "- To `QWATCH` a large number of queries."

### Limitations

- WebSockets are not supported in all browsers. Please refer to the [MDN WebSockets documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for more information.
- WebSockets are stateful connections and need to be managed by the client. This means that the client needs to handle reconnections in case of network failures.
- In case of faster updates than the client can handle, the standard WebSocket from the browser does not implement a built-in backpressure mechanism. This means the device memory can fill up until the client handles the messages.
