## Introduction

DiceDB supports WebSocket for connecting to the database, allowing for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. This can be particularly useful for applications that require low-latency, high-frequency updates.

## Connecting to the WebSocket Server

To connect to the WebSocket server, use the following URL:

```
ws://your-server-address:port/
```

Replace `your-server-address` and `port` with the appropriate values for your server.

## Message Format

WebSocket messages should be sent as plain text, following this format:

```
COMMAND arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
```

- The command should be in uppercase.
- Arguments should be separated by spaces.
- For commands that require JSON data, include it as the last argument.

This is very similar to what you'd type in the DiceDB CLI.

## Supported Commands

All DiceDB commands are supported over the WebSocket protocol. If some commands are not supported, they will be flagged as such in the command documentation.

For more information on specific commands and their usage, please refer to the command documentation, keeping in mind the WebSocket-specific formatting requirements outlined in this guide.

### Special Commands

- `ABORT`: This command will shut down the WebSocket server.

## Responses

Responses are sent back through the WebSocket connection as JSON-encoded data. The structure of the response will depend on the command executed.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to interact with the WebSocket server using JavaScript:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://your-server-address:port/ws');

ws.onopen = function() {
    console.log('Connected to WebSocket server');
    
    // Set a key
    ws.send('SET mykey "Hello, WebSocket!"');
};

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Received:', event.data);
};

ws.onerror = function(error) {
    console.error('WebSocket Error:', error);
};

ws.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket connection closed:', event.code, event.reason);
};
```
