description: A golang SDK for building high performance applications with DiceDB.

The DiceDB Go SDK provides support for all the standard Redis commands plus specialized DiceDB watch commands for monitoring changes to data in real-time.

## Installation

To install the DiceDB Go SDK, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go
```

## Basic Usage

The SDK maintains compatibility with [go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) for standard Redis operations. If you're using go-redis, you can transparently switch to dicedb-go with minimal changes to your application code.

```go
import "github.com/dicedb/dicedb-go"

func main() {
    client := dicedb.NewClient(&dicedb.Options{
        Addr: "localhost:6379",
    })
    defer client.Close()

    // Use like standard go-redis
    err := client.Set(ctx, "key", "value", 0).Err()
    val, err := client.Get(ctx, "key").Result()
}
```

## Watch Commands

### Creating a Watch Connection

`WatchConn` creates a new watch connection. You can listen on results of different commands using this connection.

```go
watch := client.WatchConn(ctx)
defer watch.Close()
```

#### Watching Commands

There are two ways to watch commands using a `WatchConn` object:

##### 1. Generic Watch method

The first argument is the context, followed by the command and its arguments:

```go
result, err := watch.Watch(ctx, "GET", "mykey")
// Or
result, err := watch.Watch(ctx, "ZRANGE", "myset", "0", "-1", "REV", "WITHSCORES")
```

Note: Ensure that the command you're watching is supports reactivity.

##### 2. Command-specific convenience methods:

The first argument is the context, followed by the command's arguments.

```go
// convenience method for GET.WATCH
result, err := watch.GetWatch(ctx, "mykey")

// Or

// convenience method for ZRANGE.WATCH
result, err := watch.ZRangeWatch(ctx, "myset", "0", "-1", "REV", "WITHSCORES")
```

Each watch command returns a `WatchResult` object containing the initial result of the watched command.

#### WatchResult Structure
The `WatchResult` object contains the updated data along with the command being watched and a unique fingerprint to identify the source of the update:

```go
type WatchResult struct {
    Command     string      // The command being watched
    Fingerprint string      // Unique identifier for the watch command to help identify the source of the update.
    Data        interface{} // Command result data
}
```

The `Data` field contains the result of the watched command, and can be type-asserted based on the command being watched.

For example, the `Data` field for:
1. `ZRANGE.WATCH` command will be of type `[]dicedb.Z`.
2. `GET.WATCH` command will be of type `string`.

#### Channel-based Monitoring

To receive subsequent updates to the result set, use the Channel method:

```go
ch := watch.Channel(dicedb.WithWChannelSize(100))
for msg := range ch {
    // Process msg.Data based on msg.Command
}
```
Note: The `Channel` method must be called after the initial watch command has been executed.

Channel configuration options:
- `WithWChannelSize(size int)`: Set channel buffer size (default: 100)
- `WithWChannelHealthCheckInterval(d time.Duration)`: Set health check interval (default: 3s)
- `WithWChannelSendTimeout(d time.Duration)`: Set message send timeout (default: 60s)


### Watching a Sorted Set

```go
func watchZSet() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    client := dicedb.NewClient(&dicedb.Options{
        Addr: "localhost:6379",
    })
    defer client.Close()

    // Create a watch connection
    watch := client.WatchConn(ctx)
    defer watch.Close()

    // Start watching ZRANGE results
    result, err := watch.ZRangeWatch(ctx, "myset", "0", "-1", "REV", "WITHSCORES")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Get updates through channel
    ch := watch.Channel()
    for msg := range ch {
        scores := msg.Data.([]dicedb.Z)
        for _, z := range scores {
            fmt.Printf("Member: %s, Score: %f\n", z.Member, z.Score)
        }
    }
}
```
