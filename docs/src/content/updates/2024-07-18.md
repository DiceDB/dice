Agenda:

- First community call ðŸŽ‰
- The documentation website is up: [https://dicedb-docs.netlify.app/](https://dicedb-docs.netlify.app/)
- Plan to keep DiceDB a drop-in replacement of Redis, however, redis feature-set completion wonâ€™t be a blocker for launch.
- Aim to support a basic, foundational feature set
- Plans for real-time reactivity:
- Support for JSON
- Filtering on JSON fields
- Optimizations for DSQL query executor:
- Instead of re.match use a specific regex matcher for better performance.
