# Roadmap

As of today, DiceDB consists of four primary pods, each focusing on a critical aspect of the system.
These pods are:

- Database Engine
- HA, Scale, and Fault Tolerance
- Developer Experience
- Observability and 3P Integrations

Each pod will drive one or more active macro features or initiatives, with the entire
community collaborating to achieve these goals. Below is an overview of the active
items in each pod:

## Database Engine

> Focused on enhancing the core database capabilities, such as supported data structures and performance optimizations.

1. Support for Vectors
2. I/O Optimizations

## HA, Scale, and Fault Tolerance

> Aiming to scale DiceDB beyond a single machine and ensure resilience.

1. Replication
2. Snapshots

## Developer Experience

> Focused on tools and interfaces like documentation, SDKs, CLI, Playground, and Console to enhance developer productivity.

1. Command search in Playground

## Observability and 3P Integrations

> Enhancing monitoring and integration capabilities for better observability and seamless third-party tooling support.

1. DiceDB observability through Prometheus

> This is not an exhaustive list, Please refer to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice/issues) to find the granular items that are being worked upon.
