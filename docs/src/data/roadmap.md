# Roadmap

As of today, DiceDB consists of four primary pods, each focusing on a critical aspect of the system.
These pods are:

- Database Engine
- HA, Scale, and Fault Tolerance
- Developer Experience
- Observability and 3P Integrations

Each pod will drive one or more active macro features or initiatives, with the entire
community collaborating to achieve these goals. Below is an overview of the active
items in each pod:

## Database Engine

> Focused on enhancing the core database capabilities, such as supported data structures and performance optimizations.
