package object

// Obj represents a basic object structure that includes metadata about the object
// as well as its value. This struct is designed to store the core data (value)
// of the object along with additional properties such as encoding type and access
// time. The structure is intended to support different types of objects, including
// simple types (e.g., int, string) and more complex data structures (e.g., hashes, sets).
//
// Fields:
//
//   - TypeEncoding: A uint8 field used to store the encoding type of the object. This
//     helps in identifying how the object is encoded or serialized (e.g., as a string,
//     number, or more complex type). It is crucial for determining how the object should
//     be interpreted or processed when retrieved from storage.
//
//   - LastAccessedAt: A uint32 field that stores the timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds)
//     representing the last time the object was accessed. This field helps in tracking the
//     freshness of the object and can be used for cache expiry or eviction policies.
//     in DiceDB we use 32 bits due to Go's lack of native support for bitfields,
//     and to simplify management by not combining
//     `TypeEncoding` and `LastAccessedAt` into a single integer.
//
//   - Value: An `interface{}` type that holds the actual data of the object. This could
//     represent any type of data, allowing flexibility to store different kinds of
//     objects (e.g., strings, numbers, complex data structures like lists or maps).
type Obj struct {
	// TypeEncoding holds the encoding type of the object (e.g., string, int, complex structure)
	TypeEncoding uint8

	// LastAccessedAt stores the last access timestamp of the object.
	// It helps track when the object was last accessed and may be used for cache eviction or freshness tracking.
	LastAccessedAt uint32

	// Value holds the actual content or data of the object, which can be of any type.
	// This allows flexibility in storing various kinds of objects (simple or complex).
	Value interface{}
}

// ExtendedObj is an extension of the `Obj` struct, designed to add extra
// metadata for more advanced use cases. It includes a reference to an `Obj`
// and an additional field `ExDuration` to store a time-based property (e.g.,
// the duration the object is valid or how long it should be stored).
//
// This struct allows for greater flexibility in managing objects that have
// additional time-sensitive or context-dependent attributes. The `ExDuration`
// field can represent the lifespan, expiration time, or any other time-related
// characteristic associated with the object.
//
// **Caution**: `InternalObj` should be used selectively and with caution.
// It is intended for commands that require the additional metadata provided by
// the `ExDuration` field. Using this for all objects can complicate logic and
// may lead to unnecessary overhead. It is recommended to use `ExtendedObj` only
// for commands that specifically require it and when additional metadata is
// necessary for the functionality of the command.
//
// Fields:
//
//   - Obj: A pointer to the underlying `Obj` that contains the core object data
//     (such as encoding type, last accessed timestamp, and the actual value of the object).
//     This allows the extended object to retain all of the functionality of the basic object
//     while adding more flexibility through the extra metadata.
//
//   - ExDuration: Represents a time-based property, such as the duration for which
//     the object is valid or the time it should be stored or processed. This allows for
//     managing the object with respect to time-based characteristics, such as expiration.
type InternalObj struct {
	// Obj holds the core object structure with the basic metadata and value
	Obj *Obj

	// ExDuration represents a time-based property, such as the duration for which
	// the object is valid or the time it should be stored or processed.
	ExDuration int64
