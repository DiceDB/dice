// CreatePushResponse creates a push response. Push responses refer to messages that the server sends to clients without
// the client explicitly requesting them. These are typically seen in scenarios where the client has subscribed to some
// kind of event or data feed and is notified in real-time when changes occur.
// `key` is the unique key that identifies the push response.
