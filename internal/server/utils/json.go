// This method returns the path, and a boolean value telling if the path provided follows Legacy Path Syntax or JSONPath syntax.
// JSON knows which syntax to use depending on the first character of the path query.
// If the query starts with the character $, it uses JSONPath syntax. Otherwise, it defaults to the legacy path syntax.
// A JSONPath query can resolve to several locations in a JSON document.
// In this case, the JSON commands apply the operation to every possible location. This is a major improvement over legacy path queries, which only operate on the first path.
