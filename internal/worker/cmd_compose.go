// This file contains functions used by the Worker to handle and process responses
// from multiple shards during distributed operations. For commands that are executed
// across several shards, such as MultiShard commands, dedicated functions are responsible
// for aggregating and managing the results.
//
// Each function takes a variable number of shard responses as input, applies command-specific
// logic to evaluate or combine these responses, and returns the final outcome to the client.
//
// The goal is to provide a unified response that accurately reflects the result of operations
// executed across multiple shards, ensuring the client receives a single, coherent result.
//

// composeRename processes responses from multiple shards for a "Rename" operation.
// It iterates through all shard responses, checking for any errors. If an error is found
// in any shard response, it returns that error immediately. If all responses are successful,
// it returns an "OK" response to indicate that the Rename operation succeeded across all shards.
